# Hi, I'm Brandon Howe

## I'm a motivated, self-driven developer with a focus on learning and building new things.

I have over 3 years of professional experience at Mechanical Solutions, Inc. and over a decade of hobby experience. I am an undergrad at New Jersey Institute of Technology studying CS and math and on the Division I fencing team. Currently studying modern C. My resume can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bPun3CpeeiSJhcxme45GAQuy8_imH3ug/view?usp=sharing).

## What I've worked on

Some of these projects don't have public source code for various reasons. The ones that do are linked on my profile.

* [Mechanical Solutions](https://mechsol.com) - I've worked at Mechanical Solutions since May 2022. In general I've helped with bringing a modern UI and WPF codebase to VibVue. Recently I've been doing lots of optimizations on video analysis, achieving over a 1000% performance increase in certain areas.
* [Touch by Touch](https://tbtfencing.com) - My main project. TbT is a live scorekeeping and team management service for fencing. Currently it services NCAA meets as well as the NJ high school fencing scene.
* [COOL Compiler](https://github.com/BrandonHowe/cool-compiler) - typechecker and optimizing compiler for the COOL programming language. It type checks COOL programs, then generates x86 assembly with a variety of dataflow and performance optimizations.
* [Disco Tower](https://brandonhowe.github.io/DiscoTower/) - A game I made in 24 hours for GirlHacks 2024. The central concept is that it is a rhythm-based roguelike, where you can take actions on each beat of the music.
* [Project Unknown](https://github.com/Project-Unknown-GH) - I developed a series of world-class bots that monitored luxury clothing brands for inventory changes. The bots would send restock information to paid members of a reselling group called Project Unknown in real time.
* [King Typer](https://github.com/vycdev/king-typer) - I worked on this project with a friend for the Romanian national olympiad [Infoeducatie](https://infoeducatie.ro). King Typer is a site where you can learn to touch type, practice your skills, and compete with others in a real-time multiplayer environment. Note: site is now down due to Heroku removing their free tier

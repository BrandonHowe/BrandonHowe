### What I'm working on

Right now I am working on [CategoryBox](https://github.com/xWafl/CategoryBox), a web-based platform to help novice mathematicans learn category theory. It is written in Purescript (and TypeScript for the rendering, but I'm going to be working on moving off of that in the future).

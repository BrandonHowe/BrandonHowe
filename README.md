# Hi, I'm xWafl

## I'm a motivated, self-driven web developer with a focus on learning and building new things.

### About me

I have been coding on and off since the age of 8, and I have been coding a lot since two years ago. Since then, my focus has been primarily on web development. You can contact me on Discord as [ImperialWater#2125](https://discord.com/users/371244109383335937).

### Projects

* Petris - My first major project. It was a large project, with the web portion spanning 6 months. The purpose of it was to gather enough data to make a neural network to solve the P vs NP problem, though unfortunately this approach was rendered fruitless.
* Project Unknown - I was hired as a developer to work for the cook group Project Unknown. I built website monitors, as well as a website with a payment system.
* King Typer - I worked on this project with a colleague for the Romanian coding contest, [Infoeducatie](https://infoeducatie.ro). This project is a typing site, where you could learn to type, practice your skills, and compete with others. The site is now down due to hosting issues.
* TouchByTouch (private) - I developed the website for a service which allows people to view and score tournaments and dual meets for high school fencing. Viewable at [tbtfencing.com](https://tbtfencing.com).

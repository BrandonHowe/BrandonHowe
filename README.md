# Hi, I'm Brandon Howe

## I'm a motivated, self-driven developer with a focus on learning and building new things.

I have 2 and a half years of professional experience at Mechanical Solutions, Inc. and over a decade of hobby experience. Currently studying modern C. My resume can be found here.

## What I've worked on

Many of these projects don't have public source code for various reasons. The ones that do are linked on my profile.

* [Mechanical Solutions](https://mechsol.com) - I've worked at Mechanical Solutions since May 2022. In general I've helped with bringing a modern UI and WPF codebase to VibVue. Recently I've been doing lots of optimizations on video analysis, achieving over a 1000% performance increase in certain areas.
* [Touch by Touch](https://tbtfencing.com) - My main project. TbT is a live scorekeeping service for fencing. Right now it services NCAA meets as well as the NJ high school fencing scene.
* [Disco Tower](https://brandonhowe.github.io/DiscoTower/) - A game I made in 24 hours for GirlHacks 2024. The central concept is that it is a rhythm-based roguelike, where you can take actions on each beat of the music.
* Project Unknown - I developed a series of world-class bots that monitored luxury clothing brands for restocks. The bots would send info about restocks to paying members of a reselling group called Project Unknown
* King Typer - I worked on this project with a friend for the Romanian national olympiad [Infoeducatie](https://infoeducatie.ro). King Typer is a site where you can learn to touch type, practice your skills, and compete with others in a real-time multiplayer environment. Note: site is now down due to Heroku removing their free tier
* Petris - My first major project. Petris is a modified version of Tetris with different pieces and game modes, with intent to gather enough data to make a neural network to solve the P vs NP problem, though unfortunately this approach was rendered fruitless. Note: site is now down due to Heroku removing their free tier

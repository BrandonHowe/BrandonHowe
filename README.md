# Hi, I'm xWafl

## I'm a motivated, self-driven web developer with a focus on learning and building new things.

### About me

I have been coding on and off since the age of 8, and I have been coding a lot since just over a year ago. Since then, my focus has been primarily on web development.

### Projects

All these projects have a front-end, a back-end, and a database.

* Petris - My first major project. It was a large project, with the web portion spanning 6 months. The purpose of it was to gather enough data to make a neural network to solve the P vs NP problem.
* Project Unknown - I was hired as a developer to work for the cook group Project Unknown. I built website monitors, as well as a website with a payment system.
* King Typer - I worked on this project with a colleague for the Romanian coding contest, [Infoeducatie](https://infoeducatie.ro). This project is a typing site, where you could learn to type, practice your skills, and compete with others.

### Skills

Skills | Tools | Intermediate skills
:----- | :---: | ------------------:
VueJS | Nuxt | Angular
TypeScript | Mocha/Chai | Purescript
PostgreSQL | Knex |
Git | Github CI |

I can also work with package managers (NPM, Yarn, etc) and hosting platforms (Heroku, DO).

### Collaboration

I can collaborate with other people on code seamlessly and easily. I am capable of using Git to have detailed commit messages, separate branches, and pull requests. I understand the differences between merging, rebasing, and squash-merging, and I can label pull requests according to their uses.
